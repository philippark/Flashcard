flashcards for pronunciation

- get regular spaced retrieval flashcards mechanically done:
* allow user to say again (1min), hard, good, easy.
* keep track of time, 
* increment spaced retrival

later on:
- allow multiple study decks (which datastructure to use? how to store all this data?)
- implement QT

- allow user input audio
- use an api to get pronunciation audio




3/7/24:
- just for today, lets allow 2 options: pass, fail. If pass, set next study date to next day. If fail, don't change date.
- then let the pq for deck to store based on dates. For now, let's do only 0 for today, 1 for tmrw. So essentially, for now use interval.
what i need:
- flashcard getDueDate(), and update() which takes in score. (1 for pass, 0 for fail).


then for the future, slowly build the complexity of spaced repitition algo
