flashcards for pronunciation

- get regular spaced retrieval flashcards mechanically done:
* allow user to say again (1min), hard, good, easy.
* keep track of time, 
* increment spaced retrival

later on:
- allow multiple study decks (which datastructure to use? how to store all this data?)
- implement QT

- allow user input audio
- use an api to get pronunciation audio
